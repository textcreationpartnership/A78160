            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When you firſt acquainted me with your purpoſe to anſwer that tract (which was before I had ſeen it, it being then but manuſcript, and had onely heard from you the drift of it) you well remember what my judgement was, that in polemicall writings, it was beſt to forbeare the perſons of men, and to hold cloſe to the Argument.

            <p>For my part I thus judge, That if men would can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly carry this controverſie to its native and proper iſſue, it would amount to this. 1. Whether the graces of faith, perſeverance, and the glory follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be not Gods owne? 2. Whether being ſo, he may not do what he will with his owne? 3. If ſo, whether he might not, <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> abſolutely purpoſe in himſelfe, on whom to beſtow them, from whom to with-hold them, without any injury unto any? 4. Whether it imply a contradiction, for God by his power ſo to determine the will of the creature, <hi>hic &amp; nunc ad unum,</hi> as that it ſhall retaine its own nature, and yet ſhall not <hi>de facto,</hi> fully and victoriouſlie reſiſt divine grace, but ſhall invincibly and moſt certainely, as to Gods determination, and yet moſt ſweetly and willingly, as to its owne manner of working, make choice of that good, in the choice whereof, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively convinced, that its felicity doth ſtand?
<pb facs="tcp:168444:13"/> If this imply not a contradiction, (as I beleeve it will be difficult for him to prove, who ſhall undertake it, for why may not God determine the will, as eaſily as the will can determine it ſelfe?) then ſure I am, that that omnipotency which could ſay, let there be light, and there was light, can ſay, let there be a will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to converſion, and there ſhall bee ſuch a will: That Omnipotency which could give a creature a Being out of nothing, can by an invincible perſwaſion or traction (the radicall indifferency of the will remaining ſtill the ſame) ſuſpend the actuall praevalent reluctancy thereof, and worke it determinately unto ſuch an action, as is rationally moſt convenient and behoove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a rationall appetite, as the will is, <hi>viz.</hi> to chooſe its own bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſedneſs: for that is it which every convert in his effectuall vocation, by the power of grace really doth. 5. Whether the Lord hath not been pleaſed ſo to reveale in the Scripture the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his decrees touching his purpoſe, of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelfe in a way of mercy and juſtice, as that there ſhall be an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the creature to ſtop at, and to adore, that he will not have his counſels fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the ſhallow line of humane reaſon, but when he doth with his creature, as the Potter with his clay, of the ſame common and equall lump, chooſe one part unto honour, and leave another unto diſhonour, his purpoſe be not, that we ſhould acknowledge and adore his Soveraignty, and lay our hands on our mouth, as amazed at the unſearchableneſſe of his judgements? Now, certainly in all this there is no blaſphemy. God doth permit ſinne, and whatever he doth, he doth by the counſell of his own will, therefore he did <hi>ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> decree to permit it; for otherwiſe he could by confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grace, have hindered and prevented the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, as well in all Angels, as in ſome, as well in Adam, as in Angels, and that without any violence offered to their nature at all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. neither can there be given any cauſe out of God
<pb facs="tcp:168444:14"/> himſelfe, and the counſell of his owne will, leading and inducing him rather to permit, then hinder it. He did decree to permit it in order to his own glory, which is the ſupreme end, and therefore by him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely willed, becauſe the being thereof by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable wiſdome and power was ordinable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. He may out of that common and equall maſſe, wherein he did decree to permit it, decree in ſome in whom he did permit it, to pardon it, and on them to ſhew free mercy, in others to puniſh it, and in them to ſhew due and deſerved juſtice, the one having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt of, becauſe the grace which ſaves them, was Gods, the other nothing to complaine of, becauſe the ſinne which ruines them is their owne. He may by this huge diſcrimination of perſons, who were in their lump and maſs equall, and in themſelves indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, ſhew the abſolute ſoveraignty which he hath over them, as the Potter over his clay. He may by his moſt ſweet, and yet moſt powerfull efficacie, work the graces of faith, repentance, new obedience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in the wils and hearts of thoſe on whom he will ſhew mercy, giving them efficaciouſly, both to will and to doe of his own good pleaſure, and leave others to their own pride and ſtubburnneſs, his grace being his own to do what he will withall. And I ſay once againe, in all this there is neither modeſt nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods glory is dearer to him then all the things in the world beſides are, or can be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every attribute of God, is infinitely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely glorious, and the glory of every one of them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely deare unto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever is infinitely and abſolutely glorious in God, he may by an abſolute will and purpoſe, decree to ſhew forth the glory thereof in his works, without fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching an antecedent Reaſon <hi>ab extra,</hi> from without himſelfe, leading and inducing him to make ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:168444:14"/> 4. The ſubject on which God is abſolutely pleaſed to manifeſt the glory of his mercy and juſtice as to mankinde, is <hi>maſſa perdita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Out of this maſs of loſt or lapſed mankinde, he hath <hi>ex mero beneplacito,</hi> choſen ſome unto glory and ſalvation, for the manifeſtation of his free and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy, and paſsed by others leaving them under deſerved wrath, for the manifeſtation of his juſtice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That ſuch and ſuch particular perſons out of the ſame equally corrupted maſs are choſen, and others are rejected, belongeth unto the deep and hidden counſell of God, whoſe judgements are unſearchable, and his waies paſt finding out, to whoſe ſoveraignty it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to forme out of the ſame lump, one veſsell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honour, and another unto diſhonour, to ſhew mercy on whom hee will ſhew mercy, and to paſs by whom he will paſs by.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

            <p n="8">8. All thoſe intermediate diſpoſitions between the decree and the execution thereof, whereby the ſubject is fitted for ſuch manifeſtation of Gods glory, if they be gracious, they are by Gods eternall will, decreed to be wrought, and accordingly are in time effectually wrought by himſelfe and his grace, in and with the will of the creature. If they be evill and ſinfull, they are in his eternall purpoſe permitted to bee wrought, and are in time actually wrought by the deficient and corrupt will of the creature, and being ſo wrought, are powerfully ordered by the wiſe and holy will of the Creator to his glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So then, God did <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> moſt abſolutely wil and decree his owne glory, as the ſupreme end of all, conſulting therein the counſell of his owne will, and not the wils of any of his creatures.</p>

            <p n="3">3. In order to the ſame ſupreme end, he did leave ſome Angels, and ſome lapſed men to themſelves, to their own mutability and corruption, not being a debtor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But he did not ordaine any creature to abſolute damnation but to damniaton for ſin; into which they fal (as they themſelves know) by their own wils &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are themſelves the alone cauſes and authors; Gods work about ſinne being only a willing permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a wiſe, powerfull and holy <hi>Gubernation,</hi> but no actuall efficiency unto the formall being and obliquity thereof.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Authour of this Copy, (for the ſight whereof I thank you) as hee diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a man of an inſolent spirit, ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his adverſaries, under the notion <hi>of the halfe witted rabble of abſolute praedeſtinarians,</hi> ſo he ſeems to be ſome <hi>Novitius</hi> in theſe controverſies, being either groſly ignorant of the anſwers given long ſince to his Arguments, or ſcornfully negligent to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. The miſchiefe which theſe notions may do, upon weake and unſtable judgements, juſtly cals for your beſt endeavours to antidote and prevent it. For as they ſay, poiſon given in ſtrongeſt wines, is moſt deadly; ſo is error tempered or adminiſtred by men of Parts and Wit; whereof this author is ſuppoſed to have his portion. Had he (which I wiſh) but as much grace, he would not exerciſe his Parts of Nature, againſt the free grace of God. To speake to each particular, is your undertaking; I ſhall onely make ſome generall Animadverſions, and leave them to you to improve them, to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hee takes no notice of the uſuall diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods decree, and the execution of it, but jumbles theſe both together. It is granted, that conditions goe before the execution, but not the decree. Chuſing of good goes before ſalvation, but not before the decree to ſalvation. All conditions are means tending to an end, and appointed for the ſake of the end; therefore the end is firſt intended and appointed: ſo farre as they are
<pb facs="tcp:168444:17"/> meanes, they have an efficacy in producing the end, and ſo are cauſes of it. Gods decree is <hi>actus ad intra,</hi> ergo, eternall, ergo, hath nothing going before it. It is <hi>actus independens,</hi> ergo, without cauſes or conditions. All thoſe whom God chooſeth to ſalvation, he brings them to it by fit meanes, as primarily, by making them of an unwilling will, to have a willing will, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to chuſe good, and refuſe the contrary. Himſelfe grants ſo much, if he mean clearly and candidly, when he ſaith, <hi>that the power to chuſe good, is given us meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Gods grace.</hi> But I doubt that here, <hi>latet anguis in herba,</hi> that by this power, he means not any new created habit, or gracious quality, which God infuſeth into mans ſoule, whereby the naturall motion of mans will is changed, though the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>berty of it be not taken away; but onely ſome <hi>externum auxilium,</hi> by precepts, promiſes, threatnings, &amp;c. whereby the naturall power that is in it to good, is excited and ſtirred up. His ſimilitude of the bladders plainly intimate ſo much; which can yield no help to a dead man, but to one that hath a principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſet them on worke.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee takes no notice of that uſuall diſtinction, of <hi>voluntas decreti,</hi> and <hi>voluntas praecepti.</hi> For from that ſaying, <hi>that God wils not the death of a ſinner,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that God decrees not the death of a ſinner, nor the ſalvation of a beleever but conditionally: for (ſaith he) Gods will and decree are both one; whereas the will of his decree, and the will of his praecept, are really diſtinct, for</p>
            <p n="1">1. The will of his decree cannot be reſiſted, who hath reſiſted his will? but the will of his command is daily reſiſted by wicked men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The will of his decree is eternall, (being <hi>actus ad intra)</hi> but his commands are given forth in time, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The will of his decree is immutable (being all one with himſelfe) the will of his command is mutable, as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:168444:18"/> 4. The will of his decree, is alwaies fulfilled; he doth what ſoever he will; the will of his command is ſeldome fulfilled by wicked men, and not alwaies by good men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The will of his decree, is within himſelfe, the will of his command, is that which he puts forth from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore as much differing, as the creature and the Creator.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He takes no notice betwixt an abſolute, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall neceſſity: or, which is the ſame, a cauſall and conſequentiall neceſſity. The firſt of theſe ariſing from the neceſſary connexion of cauſes, and their effects, the other from Gods decree: Hence he infers, that if God hath decreed, a man ſhould do good, then he doth it not freely, but forcedly against his will, which is altogether falſe. For Gods decree doth not infringe the liberty of the ſecond cauſes, but rather eſtabliſh it. 1. That it doth not infringe it, appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſts death was decreed, yet hee dyed voluntarily and freely, otherwiſe it had not been merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Angels in Heaven obey freely and voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet is this decreed, for they are called elect Angels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the faithfull beleeve, they doe it freely, yet they are elected to doe this. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If all our free actions and motions are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, we ſhall exclude God from a great part of that his providence, which he exerciſeth in governing the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The decrees of God dee ſtabliſh the liberty of the creatures, becauſe he hath decreed not only <hi>rem ipſam,</hi> which comes to paſſe, but <hi>modum rei,</hi> the manner of them. Why doe ſome things come to paſſe neceſſarily, but becauſe God hath decreed they ſhall come to paſſe by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes? Why doe other things come to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingenuly, but becauſe he hath decreed they ſhall ſo come to paſſe, by contingent cauſes? and the certainty of his knowledge, doth as much hinder the liberty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the certainety of his decree. For as he cannot be fruſtrated in his purpoſe and decree ſo he cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:168444:18"/> in his knowledge; therefore what he knowes, muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe by this conſequentiall neceſſity: yet none will ſay this takes away the liberty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Had this Objector been pleaſed to take notice of theſe diſtinctions, and throughly digeſted them, he might eaſily have ſeen, that they would have utterly enervated thoſe his paralogiſmes, which he cals demonſtrations, and holds forth with ſuch confidence. He grants afterwards, <hi>that God foreknowes all things, and that his certaine foreknowledge doth not hinder the liberty of mans will.</hi> And upon the ſame ground he must grant it of his decree alſo, for they are both <hi>actus ad intra,</hi> of which the rule is, that they do <hi>nihil ponere in objecto.</hi> The decree of God being an act within himſelf, whiles he puts it forth in ſome outward act, tending to execution, works nothing upon the creature. Now let him ſhew if he can, in what outward acts upon the creature, tending to the execution of his decree, he doth any way neceſſitate mans will. For outwardly he works upon him onely by morall ſuaſion, and inwardly by infuſing gracious habits, which ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and dispoſe him freely to chooſe what is good, in good actions. In evill actions he works not inwardly at all, by infuſion of any ill quality, or principles, but onely by leaving him to the liberty and free motion of his wicked will, (which he is not bound to reſtraine) and outwardly by propounding ſuch outward objects, as are in themſelves good. By which it is apparent, that Gods decree doth not at all neceſſitate mans will. Yet upon this falſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that the will is neceſſitated by Gods decree,</hi> he goes on <hi>uſque ad nauſeam,</hi> to inferre moſt abſurdly, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and contrary to all Logicall principles, that if the end be certaine, the meanes are needleſſe. If mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be certainely determined, then no need of faith, and repentance, obedience and the like: then all praecepts, threatnings, &amp;c. are to no purpoſe: Whereas he cannot be ignorant, that <hi>media ſunt propter finem,</hi> and that <hi>finis intentionis eſt cauſa mediorum,</hi> and <hi>media ſunt cauſae executionis.</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle uſeth this
<pb facs="tcp:168444:19"/> as an argument, to make us carefull, to be ſober, and to put on the breaſt plate of faith and love, and the helmet of hope, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 8. (is parts of that ſpirituall armour, whereby we muſt mainte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted us unto wrath but to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, ver. 9. He argues the quite contrary way that if we be appointed to ſalvation, theſe things are needleſſe. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>we are choſen to alvation, through the ſanctification of the ſpirit, and beliefe of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. and ſo makes ſanctification and faith, as certeine and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as ſalvation it ſelfe, we being choſen to both, by one act of Gods decree, which is both eternall and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he ſaith no: if wee bee choſen to ſalvation by any unchangeable decree, then neither ſanctification nor faith are needfull; and ſo ſevers the end and meanes, which God hath inſeparably joined together. He might as well argue; that becauſe God had determined that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould live fifteen yeares after his ſickneſſe, therefore hee need no longer make any uſe either of food or phyſick: yet this is his manner of arguing all along his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His conditionall decree drawes after it theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes away all difference between election and reprobation betwixt love and hatred. For by this, <hi>Eſau</hi> is loved, as well as <hi>Jacob,</hi> if he chuſeth good; and <hi>Jacob</hi> hated as well as <hi>Eſau,</hi> if hee chuſeth evill, and both theſe lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meerly to the liberty of their own will, whereas it is ſaid, that God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before they had done good or evill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He makes the decree of God to be uncerteine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no certaine object, neither ſalvation nor damnation is the certeine object, it being equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to both theſe, and both theſe cannot conſiſt together, being contraries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It makes Gods decree to have a beginning and an end: his conditionall decree hath an end, and his abſolute
<pb facs="tcp:168444:19"/> decree a beginning; for this takes no place, till the other bee expired. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You do ſet downe and explaine, that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinion, which you have about Gods providence in the evill of the creatures ſinne. 2. You bring in, as to your purpoſe, an impertinent obſervation out of Mr <hi>Hooker.</hi> 3. You are for ſome pretended concurrence with <hi>Beza,</hi> a man otherwiſe as little liked by you, as his colleague, Mr <hi>Calvin.</hi> About the firſt which you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſet downe, p. 14. in theſe words. <hi>You hope to make it appeare, that God almighty is ſo farre from being acceſſory to ſinne, and doth ſo many things to hinder it, that hee doth not permit it but in an equitable ſence.</hi> And then further to explaine and amplifie in theſe, p. 15, ſo farre <hi>from that, that God Almighty doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, as permiſſion ſignifies connivence or conſent; but he permits it, as it ſignifies not to hinder it by maine force.</hi> And p. 15, 16. [In like manner all that is done by God Almighty by way of permiſſion, is his ſuffering us to live and have that nature of the will, with which he made us. This is all that I am able to apprehend or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that God permits our ſinnes in this ſence only, and that he diſpoſes and orders them to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.] Now about this full and equitable declaration of yours, give me leave that I may a little keep touch in my promiſe made with you. 1.

            <p>THE method of your proceedings in theſe three Chapters, ſeems to me ſomewhat myſticall; In the firſt you plead ſtrangely againſt Sir <hi>N.

I know not, but ſurely enough) you begin this Chapter, p. 32. with a palpable contradiction to your ſelfe, when you ſay, <hi>That every reprobate is praedeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to eternall puniſhment,</hi> ſure then, God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or <hi>efficient cauſe of that puniſhment;</hi> unleſſe he be not the author of all that he determines to doe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts; the <hi>conditionality</hi> or abſoluteneſſe of it, alters not the caſe.

Without all craft and deceit, (as much of it lurks in generals) to put in ſome generals, which to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent attentive Reader, ſhall quite overthrow all or moſt of the particulars of this Chapter, untill, p. 47. 2 Out of my free heartedneſſe towards you, I ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe ſome Animadverſions to your text, where you are <hi>jeering, railing</hi> at, or nibling at doctrine, that <hi>cannot, muſt not be gainſaid.</hi> In reference to the firſt, I have (as briefly as the matter will beare) theſe foure things to ſay. 1. In what ſenſe our Divines ſay or ſay not, that Gods decree of <hi>election</hi> or <hi>reprobation</hi> is abſolute. 2. That in the ſenſe to be opened, that of irrefragable <hi>Archbiſhop Bradwardine,</hi> muſt needs be true, that all Gods decrees or wils are abſolute. 3.

As to the firſt, I might juſtly referre to the very firſt thing, which I have done in my firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, wherein I have at large handled this, the rather, becauſe I may hope, that that which relates to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the queſtions belonging to theſe 3, 4, 5.

Now 2. That all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in God, properly ſo called, in the ſenſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, muſt needs be abſolute, I prove eſpecially, 1. By <hi>Bradwardines</hi> Argument, as Dr <hi>Twiſſe</hi> relates it <note n="(u)" place="margin">Dr <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> Synod of Dort, and Arles, p. 68.</note>, unto which he ſubjoines another of his owne. 2. By the direct tendency, which the contrary opinion hath to Atheiſme it ſelfe, and that the groſſeſt alſo. For the firſt, He firſt proves out of <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> that if we yield not to the abſoluteneſſe of Gods decree, we muſt like wicked men, <hi>ambulare in circulo,</hi> walke the rounds till our heads runne round. His argument is thus: <hi>If there be any conditionall will in God, (I meane this quoad actum volentis, or decernentis) the condition of that will of God, is either willed by God, or not: If not willed by him, then that muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to come to paſſe in the world, without the will of God, which hee holds to be a great abſurdity: But if that condition be alſo in ſome ſort willed by God, then either abſolutely or conditionally: If abſolutely, then alſo the thing conditionated, ſhall be abſolutely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God. But if it be ſaid, that the condition ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is willed conditionally, then a way is open to a progreſſe in infinitum, which all diſclaime; for it would make us all runne round, runne round,</hi>

            <q>In montibus inquit, erant, &amp; erant in montibus illis.</q>
            <p>That which hee ſubjoines of his owne, is no leſſe ſtrong, and therefore he hath challenged all the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in the world to anſwer it, many yeares agoe, yet no Reply is made. That Achillean Argument of his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168444:90"/> in the ſame place, he ſets down thus. <hi>If any will of God be not abſolute, but conditionall, then ſurely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of damnation and ſalvation are conditionall, even to the very Acts of Gods decrees: But (ſaith he) I will evidently demonſtrate, that in Chriſtian reaſon, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be: For if any thing be a condition of the decree of ſalvation, then either by the neceſſity of Nature, or by the conſtitution of God; Not by the neceſſitie of Nature, as is evident of it ſelfe, and all confeſſe; but neither by the conſtitution of God; for then God did conſtitute, that is, ordeine, that upon the poſition of ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, faith, &amp;c. he would ordeine man to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Marke, I pray, the notorious abſurdity hereof, God did ordeine, that he would ordeine, or God did decree, that he would decree; where the eternall acts of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and ordination, is made the object of his decree or ordination; whereas it is well knowne, that the objects of Gods decrees are onely things temporall, and not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> Thus farre he, whom we may ſtile our Engliſh <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or our <hi>Bradwardinus redivivus;</hi> who, as I have heard him ſay often, when hee was but a young ſcholler in New Colledge, tranſcribed all <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> with his owne hand. A man more fit to be heard in theſe matters, then <hi>Grotius</hi> the Great. 2. As for the direct tendency of the contrary opinion about the reſpectiveneſſe and conditionality of Gods decrees, to groſſe Atheiſm; to ſay nothing of the great <note n="(x)" place="margin">In his Arcan.

               <hi>why it ſhould not be poſſible for an Infidell to turn Manichee, and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian to turne Atheiſt, if he be not one already.</hi> And poſſibly, that author of whom the ſame Doctor ſpeaks, and who in his time, was a knowne oracle to all the Engliſh Arminian party, had ſome ſenſe of this, who becauſe (as the late B. of <hi>Saliſbury</hi> obſerved againſt

            </p>
            <p>Now the chiefe Arguments to prove the tendency of the reſpective conditionall decree to Atheiſme, are theſe which I ſhall now give in ſhort, but which I ſhall, God giving me life, health, and opportunity, bee willing to draw out more largely, whenſoever I ſhall be called forth thereunto, or dared out by any of the great <hi>Grandees</hi> of the contrary faction.</p>

As for what you ſay about the reſpectiveneſſe of Gods counſell as it relates to Chriſt. p. 71. <hi>Counſell</hi> as it implies conſultation and debates, cannot properly be aſcribed to God. 2. It might relate to Chriſt as head of the predeſtinate, or the chief, yea, the only meritorious cauſe and means of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>praedeſtination,</hi> &amp; yet be no meritorious cauſe of the decree it ſelfe. The praedeſtinate were choſen in Chriſt, not becauſe they had faith, obedience, but that they might obtein them for Chriſts ſake.
